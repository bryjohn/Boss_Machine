# Boss Machine

## Project Overview

This project was done to gain practice working with express to build a backend for a course on codecademy.com. The front end of the project was already existing. The files server.js, api.js, minions.js, ideas.js, meetings.js, and checkMillionDollarIdea.js were all written by me for the project.

The primary function of this project is an organizer for a make believe evil genius. The user can manage  'minions', log brilliant 'million dollar ideas', and keep track of meetings. Routes for each of these three tasks were written in the files minions.js, ideas.js, meetings.js. And a middleware function, checkMillionDollarIdea, was created to check to make sure any edit or addition to the idea list yields at least one million dollars.
